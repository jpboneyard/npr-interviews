					<blockquote class="lead-in-txt">The NPR Interview Series was born out of The NPR touring poster show. Our goal is to document and celebrate the efforts of artists, printmakers and print enthusiasts around the world. We'd also hope to provide insight into their process and inspire the next generation of poster makers and fans alike. </blockquote>

				<p>The National Poster Retrospecticus exists to document and inspire the happenings in the poster world. We've been traveling North America with a massive collection of posters and setting up one-night-only shows since 2012. In 2014 we expanded our efforts into this here interview series. The idea is to provide insight into the world of poster designers, printers and enthusisasts. We're stoked on this new adventure and we hope it's just one of many more milestones along the way!
